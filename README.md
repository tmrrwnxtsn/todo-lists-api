[![Go Report](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/tmrrwnxtsn/todo-lists-api)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/tmrrwnxtsn/todo-lists-api)

I created this project to improve my skills in writing Go code and developing RESTful API services in this language.

The project uses the following Go packages:

* Routing: [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
* Database access: [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx)
* Database migration: [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)
* Data validation: [ozzo-validation](https://github.com/go-ozzo/ozzo-validation)
* Logging: [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus)
* JWT: [jwt-go](https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go)
